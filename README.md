# NLP Tasks with Hugging Face Transformers: Custom Implementations
Welcome to the **NLP Tasks with Hugging Face Transformers: Custom Implementations** repository! This repository showcases my personal implementations of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks using the powerful libraries from Hugging Face, primarily focusing on the Transformers library.

#### Introduction
In this repository, you will find a collection of Jupyter Notebook examples for various NLP tasks. I have taken inspiration from various tutorials, courses, and real-world projects, but I've added my personal touch to each implementation.

#### Notebooks
Each notebook in this repository focuses on a specific NLP task and includes custom implementations that provide valuable insights into solving these tasks effectively. Here's a list of notebooks you will find:
+ **eng_uk_translation_opus_kde4.ipynb**: Notebook demonstrating how to adapt a pretrained model for translating English to Ukrainian within a specific domain using Hugging Face Transformers.
+ **simple_mlm_imdb.ipynb**: Notebook demonstrating how to adapt a pretrained model for MLM task in English within a specific domain (movies) using Hugging Face Transformers.
+ ..
  
...more notebooks to come! I periodically update this repository with new implementations.

#### Usage
Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository to gain some insights. You can also adapt the code for your projects or use it as a reference for solving similar NLP challenges. 

To run the notebooks locally, you'll need to set up a Python environment with the required dependencies. You can find the necessary libraries listed in the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Tested on `Python 3.7.9`.

<sup>I hope you find the implementations in this repository informative and maybe a bit inspiring. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out.</sup> 

Happy coding and NLP exploration!
